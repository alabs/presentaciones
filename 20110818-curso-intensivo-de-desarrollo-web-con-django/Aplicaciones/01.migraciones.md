## For the uninitiated, migrations (also known as ‘schema evolution’ or ‘mutations’) are a way of changing your database schema from one version into another. Django by itself can only do this by adding new models, but nearly all projects will find themselves changing other aspects of models - be it adding a new field to a model, or changing a database column to have null=True.
